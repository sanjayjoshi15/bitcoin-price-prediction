# Bitcoin Price Prediction

A machine learning and time series forecasting project to predict Bitcoin prices using models like **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and **XGBoost**. Built during on-job training at **First Quadrant Labs** under the **Boston Institute of Analytics**.

## 📌 Objective
To develop a robust model that forecasts Bitcoin prices using historical time series data, helping improve trading strategies, manage risk, and optimize returns.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Public historical cryptocurrency data
- Columns included: `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, `Market Cap`
- Preprocessing: Date formatting, missing value handling, feature engineering

## 🧠 Models Used
- **ARIMA** (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **SARIMA** (Seasonal ARIMA)
- **XGBoost Regressor** (with lagged features)
- Model selection based on RMSE, MAE, and MAPE

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Trend, seasonality, rolling statistics
   - Correlation analysis and log transformations

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Lag features
   - Rolling means and percentage change
   - Date-time based features (day, month, weekday)

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Train-test split (e.g. 80/20)
   - Model fitting and diagnostics
   - Metrics used: RMSE, MAE, MAPE

4. **Visualization**
   - Line charts for actual vs. predicted
   - Residual plots and error analysis
   - Model comparison graphs

## 📈 Results
- Best-performing model: `XGBoost Regressor` with engineered features
- RMSE: _xx_, MAE: _xx_, MAPE: _xx_% *(replace with your results)*
- Demonstrated strong forecasting performance over unseen data

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- statsmodels, pmdarima, XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook
